## Git commands

- **git status**:check the current situation of the local repository 
- **git add**:add files to the staging area before commiting

- *git branch*: this command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It
lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.
- *git checkout*: checks out old commits and old file revisions, it is also the means
to navigate existing branches. Combined with the basic Git commands, itâ€™s a way to work on
a particular line of development.
- *git clean*: removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical
counterpart to git reset, which (typically) only operates on tracked files.
- *git fetch*: fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all of its associated commits and files.  
But, it doesn't try to integrate anything into your local repository. This gives you a chance to inspect changes before    
merging them with your project.
- *git commit--amend*: Passing the --amend flag to git commit lets you amend the most
recent commit. This is very useful when you forget to stage a file or omit important information from the commit message.
